Wine Quality Prediction
This repository contains code for predicting wine quality using a regression model. The project utilizes a dataset containing various features of wine samples, such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, and quality.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is available in the file wine_quality.csv. It consists of the following columns:

- Fixed acidity
- Volatile acidity
- Citric acid
- Residual sugar
- Chlorides
- Free sulfur dioxide
- Total sulfur dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol
- Quality

# Model
A regression model has been trained on the dataset to predict the quality of wine based on its features. The model has been evaluated using various metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score.
